## **Future Vision & Plans**

This project is just the beginning. I am committed to building this idea further, refining the protocol, and expanding its capabilities. Currently, I am seeking grants to accelerate development and bring this solution to market. The first alpha testing phase is planned for January, after which I aim to launch the protocol and start onboarding early users.
